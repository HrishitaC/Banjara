Some mongodb commands:
show dbs : show databases
use <db_name> : opens pre-existing database or creates a new one and opens it
db.<collection_name>.insert({object}) : inserts object into the pre-exisitng collection or creates the collection and inserts the object into the collection inside the selected database (referenced by db)
shows collections: shows all the collections
db.<collection_name>.find({object}): returns all items in collection which have the object (if paranthesis is empty, returns all otems of collection)
db.<collection_name>.update({query_object}, {$set: update_object}) : updates all items of collection matching the query object with the update object (query and object may not be the same) (the $set makes sure that the updated object doesn't overwrite the entire item)
db.<collection_name>.remove({query_object}): removes all items in collection that match the query
db.<collection_name>.drop(): removes the entire collection (if there was only one collection in the db then the entire db gets removed)
